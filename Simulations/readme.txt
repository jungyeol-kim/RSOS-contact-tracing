Use an accurate code depending on the type of contact networks and cooperativity scenarios you are interested in.  

e.g.,[WS-network]Cooperativity_Scenario1.R should be used for any Watts-Strogatz networks and Cooperativity Scenario 1. Inside the R code, you can control other settings (false negative rate, false positive rate, starting point of contact tracing, Turnaround times for test results).
